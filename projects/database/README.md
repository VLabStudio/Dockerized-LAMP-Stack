# MariaDB
A simple installation of MariaDB with a default initialized database.

## Notes
In the scripts folder, you can configure what default tables will be initialized for your project. And if you want a more persistent setup, make sure to map ```/var/lib/mysql/``` to a persistent folder or volume.
